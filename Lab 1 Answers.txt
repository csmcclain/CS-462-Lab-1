1. Why does this assignment ask you to create a function for messages but an action for sending 
the SMS message? What's the difference?
    The reason we create an action for sending messages is because it uses http:post and that 
    changes the internal state of our system (the twilio servers to be specific). This is in
    contrast to the get messages that uses a function. Messages uses a function because http:get
    does not change the internal state of the twilio servers.

2. Why did we introduce the secrets for the Twilio module by configuring the rule that uses the
module, rather than configuring the module directly?
    Configuring the rule that controles the module instead of configuring the module directly
    makes our code less dependend on internal states and more portable. We can now pass this
    module on to anybody and they can configure the rule for the module and use our module 
    right out of the box without having to worry about changing any internal code to make it work.
